# Criptobot

## Telegram bot written in Python

### Hackaton HackUPC 13th-15th October


This is my first proyect in my first Hackaton. It's also my first approach to the Telegram bots and the use of API's. 


It's a very very simple bot. It works just with two (infact one) algorithm, the Cesar's algorithm. It encrypts and decrypts messages.


/rot13 message to encrypt/decrypt using ROT13 algorithm (Cesar with key = 13).


/cesare 00 message to encrypt by Cesar's algorithm message.


/cesard 00 message to decrypt a Cessar's algorithm encypt message.
